# Decisions

Why SignalForge is built the way it is: the choices that are not obvious from
the code, and what was considered instead. Read this before proposing a change
to anything listed here.

## How to add an entry

- Newest first. One entry per decision.
- Date: the date of the commit that made the change, not the date you write
  the entry.
- Each entry has three parts: **Decision**, **Reason**, **Alternatives
  rejected**.
- If a part is not known, write "Not recorded" rather than guess.
- Cite the commit or file the decision lives in, so it can be checked.

## 2026-11-14 · WebSocket session revocation

**Decision.** A WebSocket stream ends when its session does. The ticket from
`/auth/ws-ticket` carries the session's role, session key (`sk`) and session id
(`sid`). `threats_ws` checks them at the handshake and again before every
message, and at least every `WS_RECHECK_SECONDS` (10 s) while the stream is
idle, using the same checks as HTTP requests (`store.session_claims_valid`).
When they fail the server closes the stream with code 4001. Logout, user
deletion, role change and password resets therefore end an open stream, and a
ticket issued before them cannot open a new one. The frontend treats 4001 as
"session ended": it requests one new ticket, reconnects if that succeeds (own
password change rotates the key but keeps this tab signed in) and otherwise
shows "signed out" without retrying.

**Reason.** Before this change the handshake checked only the ticket's
signature, expiry and type, and the stream never re-checked anything, so an
open connection kept receiving events after logout, deletion or a reset until
the client closed it. The checks are in-memory lookups, so running them per
message costs almost nothing, and with events every 0.5 to 1.5 s a revocation
takes effect within about a second.

**Alternatives rejected.**
- A connection registry keyed by session or user, closed from logout and the
  user-admin paths: closes at once even when idle, but needs hooks in every
  place that revokes a session and couples those modules to the stream, for at
  most `WS_RECHECK_SECONDS` of gain. Not done yet; revisit if the stream ever
  goes quiet for long periods or the delay matters.
- Re-checking on a timer only: simpler loop, but up to a full interval of
  events after revocation while the stream is busy.

Limits: revocations live in each process's memory, so this holds for a single
uvicorn worker (the documented setup, `build.sh` and README). The stream does
not end when the 8-hour session token itself expires; that is not covered by
this decision.
